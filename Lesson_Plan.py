    - Conclusion (Closing routines & wrap up, e.g. homework setting, review, summary etc.)
    - Assessment ({no_of_questions_for_assessment} questions for students for assessment from the topic)
    - Exact answers of assessment questions

    Your response should start with JSON object.
    I will use `json.loads()` to load your response in JSON. Give your response properly so that `json.loads()` don't create any issue.
    Do not include any explanations, only provide {no_of_days} RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.
